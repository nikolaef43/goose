Run `setup.sh <api-name>` to create the integration directory\n2. Copy `templates/config.template.json` to your integration directory\n3. Update the config with your API credentials\n4. Test the connection\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe config template includes:\n\n- `api_key`: Your API key (get from the provider's dashboard)\n- `endpoint`: API endpoint URL\n- `timeout`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n\n## Verification\n\nAfter setup, verify:\n\n- [ ] Config file is valid JSON\n- [ ] API key is set and not a placeholder\n- [ ] Test connection succeeds\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Connection Timeout\n\nIf you experience connection timeouts:\n\n1. Check your network connection\n2. Verify the endpoint URL is correct\n3. Increase the timeout value in config\n\n### Authentication Errors\n\nIf you get 401/403 errors:\n\n1. Verify your API key is correct\n2. Check if the key has the required permissions\n3. Ensure the key hasn't expired\n",

      "content": "\nThis skill teaches effective use of **beads** (`bd`), a distributed git-backed issue tracker designed for AI agents. Use beads to track tasks, manage dependencies, and coordinate work across sessions.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst, check if beads is available and initialized:\n\n```bash\n# Check if bd is installed\nbd version\n\n# Check if current project has beads initialized\nbd status\n```\n\n**If `bd` is not installed**, ask the user which installation method they prefer:\n- **npm:** `npm install -g @beads/bd`\n- **Homebrew:** `brew install beads` (macOS)\n- **Go:** `go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest`\n\nDo not install without user confirmation, as these are global system packages.\n\n**If not initialized in the project**, run:\n```bash\nbd init\n```\n\nFor personal use on shared projects (won't commit to repo):\n```bash\nbd init --stealth\n```\n\nFor contributors on forked repos (routes to separate planning repo):\n```bash\nbd init --contributor\n```\n\n## Essential Commands\n\n| Command | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| `bd ready` | List tasks with no open blockers (what to work on next) |\n| `bd create \"Title\" -p 1` | Create a task (priority 0-3, lower = higher priority) |\n| `bd show <id>` | View task details and dependencies |\n| `bd list` | List all open issues |\n| `bd close <id>` | Mark task as complete |\n| `bd update <id> --status in_progress` | Update task status |\n| `bd dep add <child> <parent>` | Create dependency (child blocked by parent) |\n| `bd sync` | Force immediate sync to git |\n\n**Always use `--json` flag** for machine-readable output when parsing results.\n\n## Task Hierarchy\n\nBeads supports hierarchical IDs for organizing work:\n\n- `bd-a3f8` — Epic (large feature)\n- `bd-a3f8.1` — Task under epic\n- `bd-a3f8.1.1` — Sub-task\n\nCreate hierarchical tasks:\n```bash\nbd create \"Epic: User Authentication\" -t epic -p 1\nbd create \"Implement login flow\" -p 1 --parent bd-a3f8\n```\n\n## Session Workflow\n\n### Starting a Session\n\n```bash\n# See what's ready to work on\nbd ready --json\n\n# Pick a task and mark it in progress\nbd update <id> --status in_progress\n\n# View full details\nbd show <id> --json\n```\n\n### During Work\n\n```bash\n# Create new tasks as you discover them\nbd create \"Fix edge case in validation\" -p 2\n\n# Add dependencies\nbd dep add <new-task> <blocking-task>\n\n# Update task with notes\nbd update <id> --notes \"Found issue with timezone handling\"\n```\n\n### Ending a Session (\"Land the Plane\")\n\nWhen finishing work, complete ALL these steps:\n\n```bash\n# 1. File issues for remaining work\nbd create \"TODO: Add integration tests\" -p 2\n\n# 2. Close completed tasks\nbd close <id> --reason \"Completed\"\n\n# 3. Sync and push (MANDATORY)\ngit pull --rebase\nbd sync\ngit push\n\n# 4. Verify push succeeded\ngit status  # Must show \"up to date with origin\"\n\n# 5. Identify next task for follow-up\nbd ready --json\n```\n\n**CRITICAL**: Always push before ending a session. Unpushed work causes coordination problems in multi-agent workflows.\n\n## Important Rules\n\n### DO use `bd update` with flags\n```bash\nbd update <id> --description \"new description\"\nbd update <id> --title \"new title\"  \nbd update <id> --design \"design notes\"\nbd update <id> --notes \"additional notes\"\nbd update <id> --acceptance \"acceptance criteria\"\nbd update <id> --status in_progress\n```\n\n### DO NOT use `bd edit`\nThe `edit` command opens an interactive editor (`$EDITOR`) which AI agents cannot use. Always use `bd update` with flags instead.\n\n### DO sync before ending sessions\n```bash\nbd sync  # Forces immediate export, commit, and push\n```\n\nWithout `bd sync`, changes sit in a 30-second debounce window and may not be committed.\n\n### DO include issue IDs in commit messages\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Fix auth validation bug (bd-abc)\"\n```\n\nThis enables `bd doctor` to detect orphaned issues.\n\n## Dependency Types\n\n```bash\n# Hard blocker - child cannot start until parent is done\nbd dep add <child> <parent> --type blocks\n\n# Soft link - related but not blocking  \nbd dep add <issue1> <issue2> --type related\n\n# Parent-child - hierarchical relationship\nbd dep add <child> <parent> --type parent-child\n```\n\n## Handling Merge Conflicts\n\nIf conflicts occur in `.beads/issues.jsonl`:\n\n```bash\n# Accept remote version\ngit checkout --theirs .beads/issues.jsonl\n\n# Re-import to database\nbd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl\n\n# Continue with your work\n```\n\n## Git Hooks (Recommended)\n\nInstall hooks for automatic sync:\n\n```bash\nbd hooks install\n```\n\nThis prevents stale JSONL problems by auto-syncing on commit, merge, push, and checkout.\n\n## MCP Server Alternative\n\nFor tighter integration, beads also offers an MCP server (`beads-mcp`) that provides tools directly to your agent. Install via:\n\n```bash\npip install beads-mcp\n```\n\nThe CLI (`bd`) and MCP server work with the same underlying database.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n```bash\n# What should I work on?\nbd ready\n\n# Create a task\nbd create \"Fix bug in login\" -p 1\n\n# Start working\nbd update bd-xyz --status in_progress\n\n# Done working\nbd close bd-xyz --reason \"Completed\"\nbd sync\ngit push\n```\n",

      "content": "\nThis skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic \"AI slop\" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.\n",
